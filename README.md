# Achieving-the-EHE-incidence-reduction-goals-in-the-US-South
This repository contains the scrips and EpiModelHIV version used for the analysis reported in “Achieving the “Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S.” incidence reduction goals among at-risk populations in the South” [Cite PAPER 1] and “Potential contribution of PrEP uptake by adolescents 15-17 years old to achieving the EHE incidence reduction goals in the US South” [Cite PAPER2]. Before proceeding it is highly recommended that researchers thoroughly read both papers and their associated technical appendix. The files provided here are the SPSS, R and slurm scrips used in the original analysis but they have been converted to .txt files for ease of access. Users will need to redefine all file and directory paths for their own use.
